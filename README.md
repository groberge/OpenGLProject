How do I approach designing software?
  I approach designing software by looking at the larger pictures in smaller parts.  I try to find what needs to be created first to allow me to build upon it to create the larger project.  In this case, it was learning how to build a triangle and then a cube.  After I had those down, it was easy to translate the cube into a pyramid and a rectangle and go from there to create the shapes that I needed.  Once I built one of these shapes, it was usually pretty easy to make the necessary changes to get another one although there were some that I needed to research or implement others' code to make them.
  
  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    This project showed me another way to look at a larger program and break it down. By breaking down larger objects into many different shapes, it further pushed the ideology that any large program can be made easier by implementing smaller parts in a controlled fashion.
    
  What design process did you follow for your project work?
    I followed the process of making sure that each smaller part of the program was working as expected prior to going to another part.  This helped me to control the number of changes that were made better so if something wasn't working correctly it was easier to find where the error was.
    
  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    The tactics that I used here will help me to design a program a piece at a time rather than trying to do too many things at once.  In this project, I could have tried to create many of the objects at once and try to implement the texture or lighting for them but instead I focused on one thing at a time and it allowed me to work more smoothly.

How do I approach developing programs?
  When looking at a large program, I try to find what classes I may need and what attributes they should have.  This is often a fluid process which changes over time.  As I create the classes, I try to think about what functions would be useful for the classes and then create functions out of steps that are performed repeatedly in an attempt to make the main() part of the program easier to implement and read.  Testing each function to ensure that it works helps to take some question marks out of the way when creating another class.
  
  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    I became more comfortable with C++ pointers and references and learned how to use them better so it helped me when it came time to write the functions to create the shapes.  They were all versions of the same struct until I needed an addition attribute, which then led to another struct that was able to be used with many of the same functions.
    
  How did iteration factor into your development?
    By making sure that each object or shape worked correctly prior to moving onto the next one, I was able to take the photo one object at a time to make continuous progress on the photo.  This approach to development and testing helped me to narrow down what might have gone wrong when something didn't work as expected and helped make the troubleshooting process much easier.
    
  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
    Due to the examples that were given being written in different ways (different functions, different steps), I realized that I can't always take someone's code and use the whole thing.  I learned to read the given code and understand it and then only take the parts that were needed to get the same outcome.  Sometimes that led to me creating my own functions and sometimes it merely led to changing some of the variable names, however it always came back to being able to understand the changes that I was making and not just making them because the code is provided to me.  This will come in handy during my career when I have to research making a change to software that I'm already working with.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  Computer Science is helping me to get my degree and get education on subjects and programming outside of the realm of my current position which can prepare me for many opportunities in my career.  Although I may not use OpenGL in a professional capacity, the challenges that I've faced in this class will make me a better programmer for whatever language I work in.

  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
    Seeing as I only have two computer classes left in my degree, I don't know how much the specifics of this class will help but the challenges that I overcame when using provided code and trying to make it work with my own may help me in the next classes that I have if I face the same obstacles.
    
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
    I don't know that I'll use graphics or visualizations in my professional path but if the need arises, I'll at least be familiar enough with OpenGL to start to understand what is needed and can build off of that to enable me to branch out into another development path.
